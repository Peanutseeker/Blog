### Critique of CNN

**CNN only generates one answer according to one input, it cannot resolve one-to-many and many-to-one sequence-related problems**

**Problems to be solved:**
1. Sequence input, one output (videos)
2. One input (CNN), sequence output (photo to text)
3. Sequence input, sequence output (translation)
4. Sequence input, sequence output about the original sequence ( per-frame video classification )

>[!TIP] RNNs for non-sequential tasks
>Actually, RNNs can perform sequential processing on non-sequential data
>RNNs take multiple glimpses at the image, and the position RNN is focused on depends on the information extracted from previous glimpses
>When generating images, **RNNs can output a series of color painting over time**, building up the entire image

### RNNs

**The whole pipeline of NLP with Encoderâ€”â€”Decoder Models**
